### simulations
Persisted in Supabase because share links (`/simulation/review/:shareId`) must be accessible to users other than the creator.

Stores Scheduling Assistant review cadence per user (or org-wide when `user_id` is null).

### user_google_tokens
| Column | Type | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| id | uuid | Primary key |
| user_id | uuid | FK → auth.users(id), ON DELETE CASCADE, UNIQUE |
| access_token | text | Google OAuth access token |

**RLS:** `users can manage own google tokens` — all operations scoped to `auth.uid() = user_id`. Added migration 013.

## localStorage (not Supabase)

Org-level taxonomy data is always stored in localStorage, even when Supabase is active:
- Role taxonomy (role names and definitions)
- Skill taxonomy (skill tags)
- Role/skill change history per member
- User switching state (demo/testing)
- Gantt view preferences (bandwidth overlay toggle, zoom level)
- Export filter configurations

---

## RLS Rules

RLS is enabled on all tables. Three roles: `admin` and `manager` (full access to all tables) and `member` (per-table rules below).

**Determining role:** A `get_my_role()` security-definer function reads `users.role` for `auth.uid()`. Implemented in migration 007.

### `projects`
| Operation | Admin | Member |
|---|---|---|
| SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE | All rows | All rows |

### `phases`, `tasks`, `subtasks`, `allocations`
| Operation | Admin | Member |
|---|---|---|
| SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE | All rows | All rows |

### `team_members`
| Operation | Admin | Member |
|---|---|---|
| SELECT | All rows | All rows |
| UPDATE | Allowed | Own row only (`id = auth.uid()`) |
| INSERT / DELETE | Allowed | Denied |

### `users`
| Operation | Admin | Member |
|---|---|---|
| SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE | All rows | All rows |

### `timelogs`
| Operation | Admin | Member |
|---|---|---|
| SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE | All rows | All rows |

### `calendar_profiles`
RLS created in migration 014. Mirrors the full-access pattern from migration 012 — all authenticated roles have identical access.

| Operation | All authenticated roles |
|---|---|
| SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE | All rows |

### `alerts`
| Operation | Admin | Member |
|---|---|---|
| SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE | All rows | All rows |

### `simulations`
| Operation | Admin | Member |
|---|---|---|
| SELECT | All rows | Own rows (`created_by = auth.uid()`) |
| INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE | Allowed | Own rows only |
| Share link reads (`/simulation/review/:shareId`) | — | Handled via **service role key** server-side; no anon RLS policy |

### `simulation_templates`
| Operation | Admin | Member |
|---|---|---|
| SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE | All rows | Own rows only (`created_by = auth.uid()`) |

### `scheduling_config`
| Operation | Admin | Member |
|---|---|---|
| SELECT | All rows | Own (`user_id = auth.uid()`) + org-wide (`user_id IS NULL`) |
| INSERT / UPDATE | Allowed | Own row only (`user_id = auth.uid()`) |
| DELETE | Allowed | Denied |

### `user_google_tokens`
| Operation | All authenticated users |
|---|---|
| SELECT / INSERT / UPDATE / DELETE | Own row only (`user_id = auth.uid()`) |
